## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Utah and a prosthetist and orthotist certified by ISPO.
My research focuses on human locomotion biomechanics and musculoskeletal modeling, with a particular interest in how biomechanical insights can inform the design and evaluation of lower-limb prostheses.

## Research Interests

- Human locomotion biomechanics and gait analysis
- Musculoskeletal modeling and simulation
- Biomechanics-informed design and evaluation of lower-limb prostheses

## News

- **[Dec. 2025]** Submitted an abstract to the World Congress of Biomechanics (WCB) 2025.
- **[Apr. 2025]** Participated in the Rocky Mountain ASB 2025 meeting.
