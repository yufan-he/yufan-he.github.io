## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Utah, and I am an ISPO-certified prosthetist and orthotist.
My training in both engineering research and clinical practice shapes how I approach problems.
I care about building models and experiments that are rigorous, but also useful in real-world settings, especially for understanding human movement and improving assistive device design.

## Research Interests

- Human locomotion biomechanics and gait analysis
- Musculoskeletal modeling and simulation
- Biomechanics-informed design and evaluation of lower-limb prostheses

## News

- **[Apr. 2025]** Participated in the Rocky Mountain ASB 2025 meeting.
