## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Utah and a prosthetist and orthotist certified by ISPO.
My research focuses on human locomotion biomechanics and musculoskeletal modeling, with a particular interest in how biomechanical insights can inform the design and evaluation of lower-limb prostheses.

## Research Interests

- Human locomotion biomechanics and gait analysis
- Musculoskeletal modeling and simulation
- Biomechanics-informed design and evaluation of lower-limb prostheses

## News

- **[Jan. 2025]** Joined the Sayu Lab at the University of Utah!
